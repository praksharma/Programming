Triaxial shear test is one of the most important tests in Geotechnical engineering. This GUI app takes in the triaxial test results as inputs and outputs the net Normal stress and shear stress developed in the cylindrical sample.

Also, it plots the Mohr-Coulomb envelope to visualise the failure of Von-Mises material.

Unfortunately, this GUIs need modification to make it work on newer versions on MATLAB.
