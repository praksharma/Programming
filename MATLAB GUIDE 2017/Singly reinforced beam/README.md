Concrete is good in resisting compression but weak in tension. When a concrete beam bends due to vertically downward load and sagging moments, the lower flange has tension and the upper flange has compression.
Singly reinforced beam have reinforcement of steel rods in the tension zone as they good in resisting the tensile deformation.

I created this very basic GUI when I was learning structural design in my Bachelors. This GUI can print the number of steel rods, its dimension and other critical parameters.

Date of final creation: 22-Nov-2017
