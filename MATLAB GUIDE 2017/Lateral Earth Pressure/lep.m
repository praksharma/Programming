function varargout = lep(varargin)
%LEP M-file for lep.fig
%      LEP, by itself, creates a new LEP or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = LEP returns the handle to a new LEP or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      LEP('Property','Value',...) creates a new LEP using the
%      given property value pairs. Unrecognized properties are passed via
%      varargin to lep_OpeningFcn.  This calling syntax produces a
%      warning when there is an existing singleton*.
%
%      LEP('CALLBACK') and LEP('CALLBACK',hObject,...) call the
%      local function named CALLBACK in LEP.M with the given input
%      arguments.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
