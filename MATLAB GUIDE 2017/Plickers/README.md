Plickers is a free card activity to conduct quiz, poll etc. with miltiple participants. They have designed around 100 cards (has QR code) that can be distcributed among participants and everytime you want some response of everyone, they can hold the card and the main instructor can scan that card with an special app.

During, TechFest 2018, in my B.tech (Bachelors in Engineering), I had the previledge to develop a GUI to calculate and display the score of each individual against their name in a single screen for a quiz contest organised for all the departments. We had 50 students for the final round. This MATLAB GUI helped us tracking the score of each individual and display it on a projector. That time Plickers app didn't had this facility.
