These GUIs were created in an older version of MATLAB GUIDE and might not work in the latest version of MATLAB App designer. These GUIs were very critical to my MSc in Computer Science offer from University of Boston.
I developed these GUIs in my free time during 2017-2019.

Well, MATLAB GUIDE files will still run on App designer but is not editable.

See this for more details: [Comparing GUIDE and App Designer](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab/app-designer/comparing-guide-and-app-designer.html)

I've attached a [PDE file](https://github.com/praksharma/Small-GUIs/blob/main/MATLAB%20GUIDE%202017/works.pdf) which I wrote back in 2018. My English was really bad at that time. You'll realise this as you go through the PDE file.

This image shows a GUI which I developed for my Bachelors thesis. It was a GUI frontend with a CMD backend, but some basic outputs were also returned to the GUI's text box. This image shows an interim version not the final version (see the Call of Duty MW logo lol). Unfortunately, I lost these files as my file system was corrupted in September 2019.

BTW, it was a FEM solver (from scratch) to solver 2D beams, frames and trusses. I had a seperate GUI to input the geometry (I lost it). It used Linear shape function. You could plot the shear force diagram (SFD) and bending moment diagram (BMD) for beams alongside the displacement.

Ok, it wasn't lost. It is still there. FEM/Thesis folder.
