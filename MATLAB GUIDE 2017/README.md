These GUIs were created in an older version of MATLAB GUIDE and might not work in the latest version of MATLAB App designer. These GUIs were very critical to my MSc in Computer Science offer from University of Boston.
I developed these GUIs in my free time during 2017-2019.

Well, MATLAB GUIDE files will still run on App designer but is not editable.
