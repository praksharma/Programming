# Chess in PyGame
This is a temporary snip.

## Progress
* Initial position of all pieces.
* Board state created.


## TODO
* Get better quality assets.
* Use the board state to move pawns based on the class name. The `self.board_state()` contains all the pieces. Just use them to manipulate the position.
