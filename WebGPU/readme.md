Course link: [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app)
## Introduction
[WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/) is a new API for rendering graphics on the web, designed to provide modern, low-level access to the GPU. It is currently in development and is not yet widely supported by browsers.

Before WebGPU, there was WebGL, which offered a subset of the features of WebGPU. 

## Getting Started
WebGPU can do rendering and compute with GPU.

## Conclusion
Okay. WebGPU is too new and experimental in many modern browsers. So, for now won't waste our time.
